# Variables
- A variable is a name given to a memory location in a program

```
name(variable) = Umair(value)
age(variable) = 😏(value)
```

## Rules for Identifiers
1. Identifiers can be combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits or an underscore(_).
So myVariable, variable_1, variable_for_print all are valid python identifiers.
2. An Identifier can not start with digit. So while variable1 is valid, 1variable is not valid.
3. We can't use special symbols like !,#,@,%,$ etc in our Identifier.
4. Identifier can be of any length.
