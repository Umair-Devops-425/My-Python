# conditional statement 
Conditional statements in Python are used to execute certain blocks of code based on specific conditions. These statements help control the flow of a program, making it behave differently in different situations.

## if condition
In Python, conditionals let you run code only if a certain condition is True.
`
x = 10

if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
`

## Adding else
`
x = 3

if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is 5 or less")
`

## Using elif (else if)
`
x = 5

if x > 5:
    print("Greater than 5")
elif x == 5:
    print("Exactly 5")
else:
    print("Less than 5")
`
