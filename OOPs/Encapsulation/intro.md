## What is Encapsulation in OOP?
- Encapsulation means hiding the internal details of an object and only exposing what is necessary.
- Think of it like a capsule (medicine) â€“ it hides the powder inside and only shows you the outer shell.
- In programming, encapsulation makes sure that data (variables) and methods (functions) are bundled together and protected from direct access.
